# My Flask App

This is a simple Flask application that utilizes TensorFlow for image processing. The application allows users to upload images, which are then processed using a pre-trained TensorFlow model.

## Project Structure

```
my-flask-app
├── app.py                # Main entry point of the Flask application
├── requirements.txt      # Lists the dependencies required for the project
├── templates
│   └── index.html       # HTML template for the web interface
├── static
│   └── uploads          # Directory to store uploaded images
├── models
│   └── model.h5        # Pre-trained TensorFlow model for image processing
└── README.md            # Documentation for the project
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-flask-app
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Flask application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the application.

## Usage

- Use the web interface to upload an image.
- The uploaded image will be processed using the TensorFlow model, and the results will be displayed.
